## 📜 Abstract

The proliferation of AI-generated imagery poses escalating challenges for multimedia forensics, yet many existing detectors depend on assumptions about the internals of specific generative models, limiting their cross-model applicability. We introduce a self-supervised approach for detecting AI-generated images that leverages camera metadata---specifically
exchangeable image file format (EXIF) tags---to learn features intrinsic to digital photography. Our pretext task trains a feature extractor solely on camera-captured photographs by classifying categorical EXIF tags (\eg, camera model and scene type) and pairwise-ranking ordinal and continuous EXIF tags (\eg, focal length and aperture value). Using these EXIF-induced features, we first perform one-class detection by modeling the distribution of photographic images with a Gaussian mixture model and flagging low-likelihood samples as AI-generated. We then extend to binary detection that treats the learned extractor as a strong regularizer for a classifier of the same architecture, operating on high-frequency residuals from spatially scrambled patches. Extensive experiments across various generative models demonstrate that our EXIF-induced detectors substantially advance the state of the art, delivering strong generalization to in-the-wild samples and robustness to common benign image perturbations.

### Key Contributions:
* A self-supervised pretext task that leverages EXIF tags to learn camera-intrinsic features from photographs only.
* A feature extractor that operates on high-frequency residuals of scrambled patches to suppress semantics and accentuate imaging regularities.
* A one-class detector that models photographic features with a GMM and detects anomalies without seeing AI-generated images during training.
* A binary detector that uses the pretext extractor as a strong regularizer, improving generalization and robustness across generators and post-processing.
